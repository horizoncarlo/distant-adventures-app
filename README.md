# Distant Adventures - Momentum Tracker
*Distant Adventures is a lightweight roleplaying game for any setting or theme, with flexible character creation, and conflict resolution based around gaining group Momentum. The ability for players to equally contribute to the story how they want in a meaningful, impactful way by growing their groupâ€™s Momentum is a key part of the game.*

This application can be used when running a remote / webcam / Discord session to allow every involved player to easily see the current state of Momentum.

Each player should join the same room/session, which is noted by a randomly generated 4-digit code (or a custom one can be set). Anyone in the same room can see and modify the Momentum.

For more information on the game you can find the free rules at:
